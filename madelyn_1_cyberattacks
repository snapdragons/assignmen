"3. Provide a summary on github of how 3 different attacks might be used to compromise identity"
The most essential elements of someone's identity are name, address, and email.
 -An attack that could find someone's name can simply be looking at a social media account for a 
   full name, but those who are more obscure can give their name away if they are sent a fake form,
   or a phishing attack.
 - An attack that can gain someone's address could also be a fake form, simply asking for it through
    phishing or other methods, or obtaining their IP address. Interfering with a connection in which this information is sent is also
    a method to obtain it.
 - An attack that can gain access to someone's email can also be fake forms of phishing attacks, however, methods that don't include social
    engineering can be exploiting cookies, cracking passwords, or viruses and botnets.
