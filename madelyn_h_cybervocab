A hacker decided they wanted to make money by selling PII to criminals.
To do this, he set up an email address similar to that of the email service.
In the email, he claimed that the user's account was vulnerable, and the service needed to know the password to it to fix the issue.
He then sent the email to 10 random people. 
7 of them rejected, but 3 gave the password.
He then entered their email address and sent 10 more emails to people in their contacts.
He  was sure to reset the passwords.
Then, he gathered the email accounts and their passwords, and sold them for a high price to those willing to use it for crime.
